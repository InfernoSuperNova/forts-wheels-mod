Api bugs:
OnLinkDestroyed doesn't get called when links are deleted or hit the ground
EnumerateStructureLinks matchSide doesn't do anything
SetEffectPosition and SetEffectDirection don't work with existing effect sprites, because they spawn a free particle
GetStructurePos either returns where it was first called, or the position of a structure when it was created






Wishlist:

OnBlockUpdated function or similar to allow for optimization of checking for block movements (useful if another mod/mission script is moving terrain blocks, and you need to reindex them every time they've moved)

Scripting functions for the spawning and manipulation of sprites, rather than having to shoehorn it with effects
Is that what AddSpriteControl is for? It doesn't seem to have any functions for setting the rotation

Disable click through of sliders and buttons etc that are loaded via LoadControl, or otherwise add some way of defining custom HUD space

GetBlockRadius, GetBlockName, GetBlockFlags, SetBlockName functions to allow full script manipulatability of terrain. And also make EnableTerrainBlock take an index or a savename, otherwise a savename would have to be assigned every time a new block needs to be disabled

GetTerrainPos and GetTerrainRadius for the circular area that terrain blocks use for collision
